Influenza viruses continually evolve to evade population immunity. We have developed a publicly-available Galaxy workflow Flu Analysis Suite, for rapid clade-mapping of sequenced influenza viruses. This suite provides rapid, high-resolution understanding of circulating influenza strain evolution to inform influenza vaccine effectiveness and the need for potential vaccine reformulation.
