# Influenza Classification Suite
Influenza viruses continually evolve to evade population immunity. We have developed a publicly-available Galaxy workflow Influenza Classification Suite, for rapid clade-mapping of sequenced influenza viruses. This suite provides rapid, high-resolution understanding of circulating influenza strain evolution to inform influenza vaccine effectiveness and the need for potential vaccine reformulation.

# Tools (in order of use)
Template files and sample input and output files can be found in the 'test-data' folder for each respective tool.

Each tool can be selected from the “Influenza Classification Suite” menu and used individually or chained together to create a workflow. 

## Change Fasta Deflines
Renames definition lines in fasta files. Requires a fasta file requiring sequence name changes and a 2-column renaming file (either tab-delimited text or csv). Searches for fasta definition lines matching column 1 and, if found, replaces fasta definition line with string specified in column 2 of the renaming file.

**Input** - Sequence file to be renamed (fasta), 2-column renaming file (txt or csv)  
**Output** - fasta

1. Create a renaming file in Excel with current sequence names in column 1 and desired names in column 2 and export in csv or tab-delimited text format
2. Upload this file into Galaxy
3. *If the renaming file is tab-delimited text, select the pencil icon beside the file name, select datatypes, and ensure the datatype displayed is "csv"*
4. Select the **Change Fasta Deflines** tool
5.	Choose a fasta file under the **“input_fasta”** parameter
6.	Choose a renaming file under the **“key_value_pairs”** parameter
7.	Select **Yes/No** under the **“Names file is tab-delimited”** (*Note: The default renaming file format is csv and the default selection is set to “No”*)
8.	Press **Execute** to start the operation

## Assign Clades
Assigns clade designations to influenza HA amino acid fasta files.

**Input** - Sequence files (fasta), clade definition file (csv)  
**Output** - fasta

1. Select the **Assign Clades** tool
2.	Select the fasta file containing the amino acid sequences under **input_fasta**
3.	Select the clade definition file under **clade_definitions** (*Note: The clade definition file must be in csv format and of the correct version for the respective flu type to obtain accurate results*)
4.	Execute the operation
5.	Download the output file

## Antigenic Site Extraction
Extracts antigenic amino acids from influenza hemagglutinin (HA) sequences, using a flu type-specific array of amino acid positions to be extracted (i.e. for H3, H1 etc.), and outputs as a fasta file.

**Input** - Assign Clades output (fasta), amino acid index array (csv)  
**Output** - fasta, csv

1.	Select the **Antigenic Site Extraction** tool
2.	Select the fasta file with protein sequences to extract under **input_fasta**
3.	Select the antigenic site index array file under **index_array** (*Note: The index array file must be in csv format and of the correct version for the respective flu type to obtain accurate results*)
4.	Choose **Yes** to output results in csv format (*Note: The default **No** selection outputs results in fasta*)
5.	Execute the operation
6.	Download the output file

## Line List
Transforms fasta files of flu antigenic site amino acids into line lists, comparing antigenic maps to that of a reference sequence.

**Input** - Antigenic Site Extraction output (fasta), amino acid index array (csv), clade definition file (csv)  
**Output** - csv

1.	Select the **Line List** tool
2.	Input the fasta file with extracted antigenic maps and clade calls under **Sample Sequences fasta**

6.	Execute the operation
7.	Download the output file

## Aggregate Line List
Transforms fasta files of flu antigenic site amino acids into aggregated line lists, comparing antigenic maps to that of a reference sequence and collapsing and enumerating identical sequences.

**Input** - Antigenic Site Extraction output (fasta), amino acid index array (csv), clade definition file (csv)

**Input** - USearch-outputted sequence files (fasta)

**Output** - sequence files with custom-formatted definition lines (fasta)
