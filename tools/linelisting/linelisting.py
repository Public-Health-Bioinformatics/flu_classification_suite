'''Reads in a fasta file of extracted antigenic sites and one containing a 
reference flu antigenic map, reading them in as protein SeqRecords. Compares each amino
acid of each sample antigenic map to corresponding sites in the reference and replaces
identical amino acids with dots. Writes headers (including amino acid position numbers
read in from the respective index array), the reference amino acid sequence and column
headings required for non-aggregated line lists. Outputs headers and modified (i.e. dotted)
sequences to a csv file.'''
